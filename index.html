            <h3>  When we draw a line the wheel rotates and thus creates pulses
                  The wheel have tinny slits on it.. As the slits changes from open portion to blocked portion IR rays are passed or stopped 
                  As the wheel rotates 1 - 0 pulses are created by encoder
                  The encoder sends the data input to the microcontroller in which all the calculations are done.
                  Then the calculated distance is shown on the display (OLED).
                  The power supply is provided to the pen through LIPO cell.
                  Charger is also provided to charge the LIPO cell
                  simply it show written straight line length in centimeter.

        <h3> To design and  develop smart pen.
            In this project , A pen is able to measure the length of the written things along with writing.
            An IR (Infrared) encoder typically refers to a device or component that is used to encode or modulate signals for transmission using infrared light. Infrared encoding is commonly used in remote control systems, where it enables communication between a remote control device (such as a TV remote) and the target device (such as a television or audio system).
            The ATmega32U4 it belongs to AVR family is commonly used in various embedded systems, robotics projects, and electronic devices where moderate processing power and USB connectivity are required. It is also frequently used in Arduino development boards, such as the Arduino Leonardo.
            OLED, or Organic Light-Emitting Diode, is a display technology that utilizes organic compounds to emit light when an electric current is applied. OLED displays are known for their vibrant colors, high contrast ratios, fast response times, and flexibility.

                     Pen can be modified to work on  curved line, circle and ellipse
                     We can add the features like finding area, circumference, perimeter and volume of solid structures
                     Civil Engineers can use it for designing
                     Architect can also use it to design the model
                     To design the model architect also can use this pen
                     also in future it will be flexible to handle
